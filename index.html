        <h2>Project</h2>

        <p>The goal of my Rise project is to create sustainable, accessible, and affordable mechanical learning kits for disadvantages middle school students to eliminate the inequality and ascertain that the soul of science and technology reaches everyone around the globe regardless of their income, race, gender, or the place that they were born.</p>
        <p>Learning kit constitutes of 3 different prototypes as shown below and you can access all photos taken from the prototyping, including slicer photos, failed prints, and the printing process of this project here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17MDvMJTzTZFlLO1_5JVJDLhwtZXpbZcZ </p>

              <h3>Nut and Bolt</h3>
              <p>This is a nut and bolt I created particulary to interest my target audience. In contrast to a traditional bolt, it has 10 entrances which makes it fascinating to play with. I was obsessed with playing it.  </p>

              <h3>Gear Reduction System</h3>
              <p>The design enables students to experiment the mechanical concept of gear reduction which empowered humanity from the start of the Industrial Revolution which is being used in engines and various applications ever since. There are 5 stages in total and each gear is free to rotate on its own.</p>

              <h3>Model Plane</h3>
              <p>I had to incorporate engineering to entertainment which would attract the attention of students, but also link the mechanical concepts to these designs. Thus, I imagined a toy plane which would utilize the nut and bolt system to assemble and have the gear reduction system to turn its propeller</p>
